#### Introduction
Today’s society is changing with each passing day, and so is the corresponding technology.
We need to spend a lot of time to keep up with the "trend" and to learn new technologies.
Is this behavior correct? There is no doubt that it is correct.
Assuming that we don’t continue to learn, we will be eliminated one day. This is very realistic.
When most people are trying to accept new things and new knowledge, then the problem will arise.
It is undeniable that some people are really talented and learn fast and well. These people will not talk about it for the time being.
What we want to say is that for most people, many people are ordinary people, with limited time and energy.
Then you can imagine that when your youth is not there, when you have a family or a burden, there is no time and energy,
So how can you interact with others in this cruel society...
Having said so much nonsense, I actually thought that "the foundation determines your upper limit" mentioned by a friend.
Therefore, when we are pursuing new technologies, we must, must not forget, to consolidate your foundation.
Because of this, the library-bc was created
